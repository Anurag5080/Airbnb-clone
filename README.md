🚀 My First React.js Project – Airbnb Clone! 🏡

Just finished building my first React project, and what better way to learn than by cloning a website we all know and love—Airbnb! ✨

Is it a pixel-perfect replica of the original? Nah, let's call it the "Airbnb: Almost There" edition. 😅 But hey, this clone gave me a real taste of React components, styling, and the power of modern web development.

💻 While the site isn’t functional yet (so don’t try booking your dream getaway just yet! 😜), it was an awesome journey into the world of React, and I’m pretty proud of how far I've come!

Excited to dive deeper and continue building! Onwards and upwards! 🚀👨‍💻
